### Hello there! :wave:

I was not expecting you!
Well, now that you're here, maybe you'd like to know a few things about me?

- :art: I'm a Designer.
- :es: I live in Alovera, Guadalajara, Spain.
- :boy: I have a son.
- :guitar: I play guitar (but I'm not that good at it.)
- :video_game: I love video games (but I don't play often.)
- :tv: I also love retro computers (I learned BASIC as a kid.)
- :wrench: I have many hobbies (because I hyperfixate on things.)
- :mag: I'm a very curious person, and passionate about my interests.

Some of my hobbies are found on **Vila Industries**: [https://vilaindustries.com](https://vilaindustries.com).  

Thanks for visiting. Hope to see you again!
