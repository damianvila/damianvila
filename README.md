### Hello there! :wave:

I was not expecting you!
Well, now that you're here, maybe you'd like to know a few things about me?

- :art: I'm a Designer, not a Programmer.
- :es: I live in Madrid, Spain.
- :boy: I have a son.
- :guitar: I play guitar (but I'm not that good at it.)
- :video_game: I love video games (but I don't play often.)
- :wrench: My hobby is soldering things.
- :blush: I'm a very curious person, and passionate about my interests.

I have a website at: [https://damianvila.com](https://damianvila.com).  
Nothing fancy, just a one page retro screensaver. I had fun coding it.

Thanks for visiting. Hope to see you again!
