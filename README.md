### Hello there! :wave:

I was not expecting you!
Well, now that you're here, maybe you'd like to know a few things about me?

- :art: I'm a Designer, not a Programmer
- :es: I live in Spain
- :boy: I have a son
- :guitar: I play guitar (but I'm not that good at it)
- :video_game: I love video games, but I don't play often
- :wrench: My hobby is soldering things

Thanks for visiting. Hope to see you again!
